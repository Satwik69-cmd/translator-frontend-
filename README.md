### Your Approach:  
- Language barriers are a major hurdle in global communication. Whether you're traveling, studying, working, or seeking help, not understanding another language can create confusion, delays, and even dangerous situations. Traditional translation tools are often slow, limited to one input type, or require switching between apps.

- As it was our first hackathon and our first team project, we ran into challenges regarding team collaboration and integrating the frontend and the backend

- I explored how ngrok can be utilized to establish secure tunnels for self-hosted applications, enabling my local machine to expose services over the internet via a publicly accessible domain, as long as the machine remains online.
